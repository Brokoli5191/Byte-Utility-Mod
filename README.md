### Story:
At the young age of 13, I created Peroxide, a hacked client for Minecraft 1.8.
I ended up abandoning the development and then I created Tidal which I never ended up truly releasing.
My life took a different direction and I quit coding for about a year and a half. Recently I got back into it and
I was asked if I wanted to help make a hacked client. I ended up making the entire thing (so far) and Byte Utility Mod was born.
Byte Utility Mod is made for the latest version of minecraft and in just 1 week of development, I have a releasable version with
a superior ClickGui compared to peroxide. I stopped working on peroxide because I wasn't making
any money but now my incentives have changed. I am working on this mod simply as a hobby
and a time killer. I hope you enjoy using it, please feel free to make a pull request. Cheers!
